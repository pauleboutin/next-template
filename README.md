# Next.js template project

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

You can use this project as a starting point for trying out Lekko by following the instructions on our [Get started](https://docs.lekko.com) guide.

## Getting Started

First, create a new repository using this template (dropdown in upper right corner on GitHub).

Then, follow the Lekko Get started guide to install the Lekko CLI and run through the initialization steps.

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

To build and run a production build:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```
